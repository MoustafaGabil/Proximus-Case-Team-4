        "email_body": "Dear [CEO of Atos],\n\nI am writing to you today with a matter of urgency regarding the ongoing Proximus project. We have experienced a series of missed deadlines that are beginning to significantly impact Proximus' operations and our ability to deliver on our commitments to our customers.\n\nSpecifically, [Clearly and concisely list 2-3 specific examples of missed deadlines and their direct consequences. Quantify the impact where possible. For example: 'The delayed delivery of the new billing system (deadline: January 15th) has resulted in a 10% increase in customer service inquiries related to billing errors.' or 'The postponed implementation of the security upgrade for the IT Infrastructure (deadline: January 20th) leaves us vulnerable to potential security breaches.'].\n\nThese delays are unacceptable and require immediate attention. Proximus relies heavily on Atos' expertise and timely execution, particularly within the Consumer Market, IT Infrastructure, and Enterprise Market sectors. The current situation is jeopardizing our partnership and damaging our reputation.\n\nI request your immediate intervention to investigate the root causes of these missed deadlines and implement corrective actions. I propose a meeting between our teams no later than Wednesday, January 29th, at 09:00 to discuss a concrete plan to rectify the situation and prevent future occurrences. This plan must include clear timelines, assigned responsibilities, and measurable milestones.\n\nI trust that you will treat this matter with the seriousness it deserves. The success of our partnership and the satisfaction of our customers depend on it.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\nCEO, Proximus",

        "email_body": "Dear [CEO of Atos],\n\nThis email serves as a follow-up to my previous message regarding the critical issue of missed deadlines on the Proximus project. As you know, these delays are having a tangible impact on our business, particularly across the Consumer Market, IT Infrastructure, and Enterprise Market segments.\n\n[Specifically mention the impact on one of the three segments. For example: 'The delays in the IT Infrastructure upgrades are directly impacting our ability to offer competitive broadband speeds to our Consumer Market customers.' or 'The Enterprise Market is experiencing frustration due to the delayed implementation of the new CRM system.'].\n\nI understand that complex projects can encounter unforeseen challenges. However, the frequency and severity of these missed deadlines are raising serious concerns about the project's management and execution. We need to ensure that Atos is fully committed to meeting its obligations and delivering the agreed-upon results.\n\nTo reiterate, I expect a comprehensive action plan to address these issues by Wednesday, January 29th, at 09:00. This plan should outline the steps Atos will take to get the project back on track, prevent future delays, and mitigate the damage already caused. I am available to discuss this further at your earliest convenience.\n\nRegards,\n\n[Your Name]\nCEO, Proximus",

        "email_body": "Dear [CEO of Atos],\n\nI am writing to you again regarding the unacceptable delays in the Proximus project. Despite my previous communication, the situation remains unresolved, and the impact on Proximus continues to escalate. The missed deadlines are now critically affecting our ability to serve our customers across the Consumer Market, IT Infrastructure, and Enterprise Market.\n\n[Provide a specific, quantifiable example of the escalating impact. For example: 'Customer churn in the Enterprise Market has increased by 5% in the last two weeks due to the delayed implementation of the promised cloud solutions.' or 'The ongoing instability of the IT Infrastructure, resulting from the delayed upgrades, is causing daily service disruptions for our Consumer Market customers.'].\n\nThis is a serious breach of our agreement and is causing significant damage to Proximus' reputation and financial performance. I must insist on immediate and decisive action to rectify this situation. \n\nI expect a detailed explanation of the root causes of these ongoing delays and a concrete plan to address them by Wednesday, January 29th, at 09:00. This plan must include specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound (SMART) goals. Failure to provide a satisfactory response and implement immediate corrective measures will leave me with no option but to consider all available contractual remedies.\n\nSincerely,\n\n[Your Name]\nCEO, Proximus",
