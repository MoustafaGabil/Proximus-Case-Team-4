These outages are affecting our ability to deliver consistent and reliable services to our customers across all segments: Consumer Market, IT Infrastructure, and Enterprise Market.\n\nSpecifically, the intermittent network disruptions are causing significant problems with service availability, leading to customer dissatisfaction and potential reputational damage for both Microsoft and Proximus. Our marketing campaigns and customer engagement efforts are being directly undermined by these unreliable connections.\n\nWe understand that network issues can occur, but the frequency and impact of these recent outages are unacceptable. We need immediate action to identify the root cause and implement a solution to ensure stable and reliable network connectivity.\n\nWe request your urgent attention to this matter and expect a detailed action plan by the end of the day today. We need this issue resolved before Thursday, January 30th, at 12:00 PM. Please provide regular updates on the progress of the resolution.\n\nWe look forward to your prompt response and a swift resolution to this critical issue.\n\nSincerely,\n[Your Name/Microsoft Marketing Team]"
