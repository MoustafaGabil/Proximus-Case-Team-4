        "overview": "Proximus has chosen Nextensa to negotiate the development of its new headquarters in Brussels at the Tour & Taxis site. This involves the sale of Proximus' current towers at the Brussels North Station to Nextensa. The move is driven by a need to reduce office space due to increased remote work and to finance the company's fiber rollout. Proximus aims to finalize the agreement in Q2 2025, with the move to the new location expected in the first half of 2027, and the new offices ready by the first half of 2029. Proximus staff are currently in temporary accommodation with a lease expiring in 2027.",
